# Introduction

Our goal in the creation of this document is to not only improve consistency, but to also allow newer developers joining our discipline to have an easy to use reference point.  Consistency is a key element of software quality and without it all of our efforts eventually turn to spaghetti.

Today at The Nerdery, the Ruby discipline is effectively the Ruby on Rails discipline.  We *do not* do much pure Ruby work and we *do not* do Sinatra work.  Thus, the focus of this document is not actually *Ruby* standards, but instead **Ruby on Rails** standards.

# Contributing

So you want to contribute to this document?  Awesome!  We openly accept collaboration and want your halp!  Please contact @sumpygump for commit access to our [repo on GitHub](https://github.com/thenerdery/ruby-standards)!  You can also open issues over on GitHub and even fork the project to make your own changes before submitting them back to main.

# Further Resources

Remember, this is a standards guide - **not a tutorial**.  If you are interested in learning Ruby then that's fantastic!  Below you'll find a curated list of some of the best resources for getting started:

1. [Nerdery Getting Started Guide]() - for getting started.
1. [Ruby Warrior]() - for learning Ruby.
1. [Rails Best Practices]() - for learning a *right* way.
1. [Blog Tutorial #1]() - Something about this!
1. [Another Blog Tutorial]() - More things.
1. [RailsGuides]() - The ultimate API document for figuring Rails out.

# Ruby Language Standards

The Ruby community as a whole is fairly homogeneous and thoroughly focused on maintaining that community.  As a result, we have an excellent [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) available to us that puts forth most of the usual "how many tabs, how to name methods" sorts of questions.  At The Nerdery, we use this.

We are extremely fortunate in our community to have [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) available to use - which will automatically check for standards violations against the community Ruby Style Guide.  Please make sure that you use **and enforce** this on any of your Ruby projects.

```ruby
  group :development, :test do
    gem 'rubocop'
  end
```

**Follow those standards and you will be set.**

# An MVC Primer

Ruby on Rails is one of many frameworks that follows the MVC design pattern.  This pattern dictates a distinct separation of concerns between the 3 major components: Model, View and Controller.  Each component represents a layer which a request works its way through as it is serviced.

Rails' concept of MVC dictates that a request is first serviced by a Controller which coordinates various components.  This generally means that a Controller will speak to various Models to gather information and feed it up into a View.

The Model Layer, as described by Rails, is responsible for handling the majority of business logic found within the application.  For the vast majority of CRUD applications, this can be the files found within app/models.  We'll talk about methods for obviating Model Bloat later.

Once a Controller has gathered enough information from the Model layer - this information is fed up to a View layer by way of class variables (`@cats = Cat.all`).  This view layer is typically a `.erb` file which leverages standard Ruby syntax intermingled with HTML code.

This separation gives us clear choices as to the locations of most items and helps to prevent spaghetti code by having different components talking which have no business knowing about each-other.

## Stepping Outside of MVC

# Rails Clean Code Basics

# Source Control Practices

## Hosting

There are 2 primary means for hosting source control on Nerdery Rails projects:

1. GitHub
1. Self-hosted Nerdery BitBucket

GitHub is our usual go-to for source control hosting as it provides the highest level of 3rd party service integration.  This level of service allows for easy integration with 3rd party tools like CircleCI, CodeClimate and Heroku.

Our internally self-hosted Nerdery BitBucket service provides a bare-bones code hosting solution that is useful when a client does not wish to pay any additional fees.  It lacks 3rd party support for tools, so you will need to budget in additional time (40-80hours) for integration with our internal CI server Bamboo.

## Branching Strategies

We firmly believe that branching strategies should be appropriate for the particular project and team-type associated.  The most important thing, when it comes to branching strategies, is clear communication and consistent amongst a given project.  As such, including a **contributing** section within the `README.md` is best practice and strongly encouraged.

An example of such a section from a recent project (2016/09/16) is as such:

> **Contributing**
>
> This project is leveraging *Pull Requests* for handling code management.  For each **feature** that you are looking to build, create a branch off of `develop` with the format of `feature/my-feature`.  Once complete, make a Pull Request and a lead should review your request and merge it into develop once complete.
>
> Before making a PR, ensure that you have merged develop back into your branch and that all tests & rubocops are passing.  Your PR will not be merged in if these conditions are not met.
>
> For **emergency fixes**, branch off of `master` to make your fix.  Once tested and complete, merge this branch back into master and then develop.
