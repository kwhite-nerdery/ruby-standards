# Introduction

Why create a standards document you may ask?  Our goal in the creation of this document is to not only improve consistency, but to also allow newer developers joining our discipline to have an easy to use reference point.  Consistency is a key element of software quality and without it all of our efforts eventually turn to spaghetti.

Today at The Nerdery, the Ruby discipline is effectively the Ruby on Rails discipline.  We *do not* do much pure Ruby work and we *do not* do Sinatra work.  Thus, the focus of this document is not actually *Ruby* standards, but instead **Ruby on Rails** standards.

# Ruby Language Standards

The Ruby community as a whole is fairly homogeneous and thoroughly focused on maintaining that community.  As a result, we have an excellent [Ruby Style Guide](https://github.com/bbatsov/ruby-style-guide) available to us that puts forth most of the usual "how many tabs, how to name methods" sorts of questions.  At The Nerdery, we use this.

We are extremely fortunate in our community to have [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) available to use - which will automatically check for standards violations against the community Ruby Style Guide.  Please make sure that you use **and enforce** this on any of your Ruby projects.

```ruby
  group :development, :test do
    gem 'rubocop'
  end
```

**Follow those standards and you will be set.**
